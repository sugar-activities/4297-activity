- To do for Milestone1 -
http://super-tux.sf.net/

Last update: May 3, 2004

These are mostly bugs:

Todo
----
H: high priority
L: low priority

[H] Frame ratio code has been changed and so the animation may need tuning.
    Somebody do some testing and change the definitions regarding this.
[M] When aborting a level, lives and score should remain the same as they
    were before. Solution: make more dependency between the game engine and worldmap
    or just backup those variables before starting a level.
[L] time runs while being in in-game menu, at least a bit (jump, go to
   menu, wait a bit, leave menu, Tux will 'flip' to the ground,
   instead of fall, pause mode doesn't seem to have this problem, only
   menu)
[L] Backscroll is really messed up right now :)
[L] change lispreader to throw exceptions instead of simply assert() on
    syntax error
[L] tux sometimes makes short jumps in the endsequence, mostly when
    going through the goal with a small jump, might be old_up related
[L] fadein/out for intro/extro would be nice
[L] when bumping a special with 2 blocks at once, it won't change direction
[L] tux get killed if he kicks a iceblock while at the same time
   bouncing on the roof
[L] in the "Welcome to Antarctica" level, the blocks next to the first growup
    look like there are 2 blocks above each other when bumping against them as
    small tux...
[L] Enemies should turn upside down after being hit by an kicked
   iceblock


Stuff for past milestone1:
--------------------------
Note that this list is far from complete, but lists some bugs that we don't want
to touch before milestone1 at the moment.
- You shouldn't be able to stand on invisible blocks, before you bumped them
- bombs should explode directly when hit by another bomb or a mr.iceblock
- we only have a global counter for multiple coin blocks. This should be handled
  per block.
- We should reduced the width of tux collision rectangle so that he falls easier
  between 1 tile wide holes.
- The enabled/disabled icon in the options shouldn't be a cross. Some people
  think the options are disabled because they're crossed. Better use a green
  check mark.

Fixed
-----

- leveleditor lacks enemies support - fixed
- points aren't reset when gameover
- when jumping into the exit with a star, the endgame music will change back to
  levelmusic after a short time
- when jupming against the 2nd multiple coin block in a level only 1 coin will
  come out.
- when you interrupted the intro (by going to credits for example) and go back
  to it, tux doesn't jump anymore
- supertux crashs from time to time - fixed
- mriceblock doesn't fall down when being squished in the air - fixed
- It's not possible to duck while jumping - fixed
- Intro/Extro textspeed is CPU dependent - fixed
- sometimes the level restarts/you die after collecing a growup - fixed
- mriceblock doesn't disapear after being kicked my another iceblock,
  not sure when exactly it happens, might depend on direction or so - fixed
- Life counter should be decreased once the die-animation starts,
   not when it ends - fixed
- background in underground levels scrolls far too slow, makes them
   hardly playable, since once too easily get focused on the
   background instead of the playfield - fixed
- tux can be killed by back bouncing iceblocks in the exit sequence
   (all enemies should be removed/turned to coins once the exit
   sequence started) - fixed
- leveleditor crashs when pressing the button with the levelsettings - fixed
- titlescreen level doesn't seamlessly wrap around, might be due to the new
    scrolling code or due to the worldmap doing the drawing - fixed
